## luralize
create a function called pluralize that accepts a word and a number and returns a string with the word pluralized with an “s” if the number is zero, or greater than one.<br />
## Flipping Coins
create a function called flipNHeads that accepts an integer n and flips coins until n heads are flipped in a row. Simulate coin flipping by choosing a random number between 0 and 1. Numbers below .5 are considered tails. Numbers at and above .5 are considered heads. Print out heads or tails on one line for each flip. Print It took FLIPS flips to flip N heads in a row. once n heads have been in a row.<br />
## Command Line Clock
a method clock that uses Java’s built-in LocalDateTime object to constantly print out the current time to the console, second by second. The program should run until someone manually kills it with CTRL-C or presses the “stop” button in their IDE. Each time should only be printed once. Your program should detect when the seconds increase and only print something out when the timestamp changes.<br />

Zero-pad single digit numbers as strings so the timestamp is always the same number of characters.<br />
## Stretch Goals
Upgrade the command line clock to show how fast the program is processing itself between time updates. Display the speed in hertz, kilohertz, megahertz, or gigahertz (Hz, kHz, MHz, GHz). A hertz is defined as “one cycle per second.” A computer that executes one operation per second is a 1 Hz computer.

Hz - 1 cycle per second<br />
kHz - 1,000 cycles per second<br />
MHz - 1,000,000 cycles per second<br />
GHz - 1,000,000,000 cycles per second<br />
